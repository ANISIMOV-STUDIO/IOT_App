- ✅ MQTT settings configurable via UI
- ✅ Full environment variable support for build-time config
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ User-friendly error recovery with retry button

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:

1. **Temperature History:**
   - [ ] Enable MQTT mode
   - [ ] View detail screen
   - [ ] Verify chart shows data
   - [ ] Verify chart updates in real-time

2. **MQTT Settings UI:**
   - [ ] Open Settings screen
   - [ ] Tap MQTT Broker settings
   - [ ] Modify host/port
   - [ ] Save settings
   - [ ] Restart app
   - [ ] Verify new settings applied

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - [ ] Build with `--dart-define=USE_MQTT=true`
   - [ ] Build with `--dart-define=MQTT_BROKER_HOST=example.com`
   - [ ] Verify settings loaded from environment

4. **Auto-Retry:**
   - [ ] Start app with wrong broker host
   - [ ] Observe retry attempts in logs
   - [ ] Fix broker configuration
   - [ ] Verify automatic reconnection

5. **Retry Button:**
   - [ ] Disconnect broker
   - [ ] Open app
   - [ ] Verify error screen with retry button
   - [ ] Reconnect broker
   - [ ] Tap retry button
   - [ ] Verify successful reconnection

## Performance Impact

- **Memory:** Minimal increase (temperature history storage)
- **CPU:** No significant impact
- **Network:** Retry logic may increase attempts, but with backoff
- **Battery:** Negligible impact

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - ✅ `.env.example` created
   - ✅ `.gitignore` should exclude `.env`
   - ⚠️ Passwords stored in memory (consider secure storage)

2. **MQTT Settings:**
   - ⚠️ Settings stored in memory only (not persisted)
   - ⚠️ Consider adding SharedPreferences/SecureStorage

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Use SSL/TLS in production
   - Implement credential encryption if persisting settings
   - Rotate MQTT passwords regularly

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These were considered but not implemented in this iteration:

1. **go_router Migration:**
   - Large refactoring task
   - Current navigation works fine
   - Recommend for Phase 2

2. **App Icon/Splash Generation:**
   - Requires design assets
   - User should create `assets/icon.png` (1024x1024)
   - Run: `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`

3. **Persistent Settings Storage:**
   - Implement SharedPreferences
   - Secure storage for credentials
   - Save last successful configuration

4. **Tests:**
   - Unit tests for new services
   - Widget tests for dialogs
   - Integration tests for retry logic
   - Recommend for Phase 2
